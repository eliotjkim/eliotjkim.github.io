## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington Department of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, with Prof. Alex Turner's [research group](https://alexjturner.github.io/). I'm working on emulating methane in chemistry-climate models using deep learning.

Previously, I spent a year at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's [Global Modeling and Assimilation Office](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/), where I worked with Drs. Christoph Keller and Julie Nicely on building a machine learning-based operator for chemical data assimilation in the NASA GEOS-CF modeling sysetem.

## Research Interests
