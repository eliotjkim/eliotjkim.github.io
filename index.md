## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the **University of Washington Department of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences**, with **Prof. Alex Turner**'s [research group](https://alexjturner.github.io/). I'm working on emulating methane in chemistry-climate models using deep learning.

Previously, I spent a year at **NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's [Global Modeling and Assimilation Office]**(https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/), where I worked with **Drs. Christoph Keller** and **Julie Nicely** on building a machine learning-based operator for chemical data assimilation in the NASA GEOS-CF modeling sysetem.

## Research Interests

- **Physics-based machine learning for Earth system modeling**
- **Atmospheric chemistry modeling**
- **Explainable AI**
- **Data accessibility**

## News

- **[Jul. 2024]** Our paper about regression-based 1km res surface NO2 was accepted in JGR: Atmospheres!
