## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington Department of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences. I'm part of Prof. Alex Turner's [research group](https://alexjturner.github.io/).

Previously, I spent a year at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, where I worked with Drs. Christoph Keller and Julie Nicely on building a machine learning-based operator for chemical data assimilation in the NASA GEOS-CF modeling sysetem.

## Research Interests
