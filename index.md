## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the **University of Washington Department of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences** advised by [**Prof. Alex Turner**](https://alexjturner.github.io/). I'm working on improving understanding of drivers of changes in modern methane trends by developing efficient, coupled deep learning models to constrain chemistry-climate feedbacks.

Previously, I spent a year at **NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's** [Global Modeling and Assimilation Office](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/), where I worked with **Drs. Christoph Keller** and **Julie Nicely** on building a machine learning-based operator for chemical data assimilation in the NASA GEOS-CF modeling sysetem.

## Research Interests

- **Machine learning for Earth system modeling**
- **Atmospheric chemistry modeling**
- **Data Assimilation**
- **Explainable AI**
